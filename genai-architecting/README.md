# Architecting GenAI [Topic: Sentence Constructor(English to Bengali(IN))]

## Business Goal
Created architectural diagrams to explain the stakeholders understand how GenAI assistants work to help construct sentences from English user input to Bengali sentences as output.

## Technical Considerations
I've used these two following diagrams: 

- **Conceptual** — a high-level diagram that is used to communicate to key stakeholders the business solution we are implementing.
- **Logical** — a mid-level diagram that describes the key technical components but does not require detailed parameters so we can quickly rearchitect and communicate to our technical team the current workload.

## Architectural/Design Considerations
- **Requirements, Risks:**
    - **Requirements**:
        - The system should accurately translate English sentences to Bengali.
        - The translation should be contextually appropriate and grammatically correct.
        - The system should handle a large volume of translations efficiently.
    - **Risks**:
        - Inaccurate translations due to distinction in the language based on dialects.
        - Performance bottlenecks with high volume translations.
        - Data privacy concerns with user input.
- **Scalability and Future-Proofing**
    - The architecture should support scaling horizontally to handle increased load.
    - The system should be modular to allow easy updates and integration of new features.
    - Consideration for future expansion to other dialects.
