    ### Sentence Structure

    ```
    [Subject] [Number] [Percent] [Noun], [Number] [Percent] [Noun].
    ```

    ---

    ### Clues and Considerations

    - The sentence is a general statement, so no specific tense is required.
    - The word "and" is used to connect two parts of the sentence. In Bengali, it is typically translated as "এবং" (ebông) or just a comma (,) depending on the context.
    - The structure is straightforward: [Subject] [Quantity] [Attribute], [Quantity] [Attribute].
    - Think about how to express percentages in Bengali. The word "শতাংশ" (Shôtôngsho) is used for "percent."
    - Consider the order of words in Bengali, which often follows a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) pattern, but in this case, it’s more about listing attributes.
