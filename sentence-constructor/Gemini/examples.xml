        ## Sentence Structure

        [World] [Stage] [be], [men] [women] [merely] [player] [be].

        ## Clues and Considerations

        *   Bengali often uses a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) sentence structure.  Consider how this might differ from English.
        *   "All" can be tricky. Think about how you might express "all" in the context of the world and also the men and women.  There are a few ways to approach this.
        *   The verb "to be" is important here.  Think about the present tense form.
        *   "Merely" can be expressed in a few ways.  Think about words that imply "just" or "only".
        *   Remember that the vocabulary table provides the dictionary form of the words. You'll likely need to make adjustments for tense, case, and number.
        *   Consider the appropriate particles to connect the different parts of the sentence.  These are crucial for correct grammar.
        *   Think about how you might combine "men and women."  Is there a more concise way than listing both?
        *   The sentence has two distinct parts.  How might you link them together?  Consider conjunctions.
        *   Remember that "a" before "stage" and "player" is implied in Bengali and doesn't need a direct translation.
