    ### **Possible Sentence Structure**  

    - **[Subject] [Verb] [Object].**  
    - **[Conjunction] [Negation] [Object] [Possibility].**  

    ---

    ### **Clues and Considerations**  

    - Start with **"We know" ‚Üí "‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶ú‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ø"** (**amra jani**)  
    - "What we are" requires you to structure **"we"** + **"are"** into a phrase  
    - **"But not"** is directly translatable as **"‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡ßÅ ‡¶®‡¶æ"** (**kintu na**)  
    - **"What we may be"** uses the verb **"‡¶π‡¶ì‡ßü‡¶æ"** (**h√¥wa**) in a possible form

    - "Out" ‚Üí Consider **‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶∞‡ßá** (**baire**)
