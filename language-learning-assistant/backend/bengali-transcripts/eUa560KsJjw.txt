oh
i have to say
to be here now
speaking with all of you
in yankee stadium one of the greatest
places in one of the greatest cities on
earth
is more than a little humbling
[Applause]
my friends
you are now nyu graduates the best and
the brightest
you have great potential and
possibilities
and therefore
you have enormous
responsibility
too
so today
i'd like to talk about the nature of
both those things and i'd like
to offer you a challenge
one
that i think is essential for your
future success
as individuals
and as the leaders that you are becoming
among the many things i admire about nyu
is that about a fifth of the students
are international
and a similar proportion
are the very first in their families to
go to college
this group is truly diverse in every
possible way
and i think that is an extraordinary
valuable and important thing
when i graduated in the early 1990s
i went on a trip around the world with a
few good friends who actually remain
good friends to this day which is
a sort of a miracle
we
trekked and traveled mostly over land
from europe to africa to asia
and that remains one of the great
formative experiences of my life
it was
an amazing adventure
the voyager
[Music]
it was
also
an important a really important
contributor to my continued broader
education because it forced me
really for the first time as an adult
to meet
engage befriend people whose views and
experiences ideas values and language
were very different from my own
see when a kid from montreal meets a
korean fisherman living in mauritania
refends a russian veteran of their
afghan war or a shopkeeper in his family
living in da nang
interesting conversations always happen
now
maybe some of you have talked about
doing something like a great trip like
that after graduation
but i'd be willing to bet one of the
first things you heard was a warning
you can't do that in this day and age
it's not safe
but here's my question
is it really just the issue of physical
safety that makes our loved ones so
anxious at the idea of us getting out
there
or is it the threat that if we look past
our frames the frames of our own lives
of our own communities structured values
and belief systems to truly engage with
people who believe
fundamentally different things
we could perhaps be transformed into
someone new and unfamiliar to those who
know and love us
see
there's no question that today's world
is more complex than it was in the mid
1990s
there are serious and important problems
that we're grappling with
and we'll continue to grapple with
but we are not going to arrive at mutual
respect which is where we solve common
problems
if we cocoon ourselves in an ideological
social
or intellectual bubble
[Applause]
now
we can see it all around us there's a
peculiar fascination with dystopia in
our culture today you see it everywhere
on film and tv
but the truth is that on balance
we have the good fortune to live in a
time of tremendous possibility and
potential a time when it is within our
graphs to eliminate extreme poverty to
end terrible diseases like malaria and
tb and to offer a real chance and an
education to everyone on this planet
but for us to move forward to keep
moving and moving forward
we have to do it together
all together
humanity has to fight
our tribal mindset
we go to the same church cool you're in
my tribe you speak my language you're in
my tribe
you're nyu alumni you're in my tribe
you play pokemon go
you're a vegetarian you like the yankees
you go to the gun range you're
pro-choice
tribe tribe tribe
see
but of course
it's not the belonging part
that is the real problem
it's the corollary
you
are part of my tribe
and they
are
not
whether it's race
gender language sexual orientation or
religious or ethnic origin or our
beliefs and values themselves
diversity
doesn't have to be a weakness it can be
our greatest strength
now often
people talk about
striving for tolerance
now don't get me wrong there are places
in this world where a little more
tolerance would go a long way
but if we're being honest
right here
right now
i think we can aim a little higher than
mere tolerance
[Applause]
think about it
saying
i
tolerate you
actually means something like okay i
grudgingly admit that you have a right
to exist just don't get in my face about
it and no don't date my sister
there's not a religion in the world that
asks you to tolerate thy neighbor
